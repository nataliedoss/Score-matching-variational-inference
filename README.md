# Score-matching-variational-inference

Algorithm to perform variational inference by minimizing a Fisher divergence. 

This is a Python3 implementation of the Score matching for variational inference algorithm described in <a href="vi_sm.pdf" download>Nonparametric variational inference via score matching</a>. A sample script to test the algorithm is below.
